    <h1>The Wine Making Process</h1>
    
    <p>Wine making is a delicate process that involves several steps, from harvesting grapes to fermentation and aging. Hereâ€™s an overview:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Grapes are carefully selected and harvested at the right time to ensure the best quality wine.</p>

    <h2>2. Crushing & Pressing</h2>
    <p>The harvested grapes are crushed to release their juice. Red wines keep the skins, while white wines are usually pressed immediately.</p>

    <h2>3. Fermentation</h2>
    <p>Yeast is added to convert sugars into alcohol. This process can take several days to weeks.</p>

    <h2>4. Aging & Maturation</h2>
    <p>Wines are aged in barrels or tanks to develop their flavors over time.</p>

    <h2>5. Bottling</h2>
    <p>Once the wine has reached the desired taste, it is bottled and prepared for distribution.</p>
